The optimised /cart/__init__.py:
The optimised code replaces the loops with single line comprehension for fetching products in get_cart making it more efficient. The Card.load is replaced with the @staticmethod as it doesnâ€™t rely on instance attributes.The redundant intermediate lists and variables are removed.

The optimised /products/__init__.py:
The optimisation includes getting rid of unnecessary loops and replacing it with the get_products to handle missing products. The hints to know what input we should give and what are the expected output. The optimized code is easier to understand and clean.
